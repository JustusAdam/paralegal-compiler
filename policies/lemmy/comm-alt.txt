# alternate version of the policy that gives it the same structure
# as the hyperswitch and mcaptcha policies
# doing it this way does require refactoring check_community_ban and check_community_deleted
# into the same function so that they can just have one marker.
# The lemmy developers really should have done things this way to begin with
# since they should *always* be called together.
# If they had, they would have had far fewer bugs...
# I think this is truer to how a privacy engineer would write the policy (just thinking about a single auth_check).
# To not require source code changes, just refactor "auth check" into two auth checks,
# one for ban, one for delete

# (to compile this policy, delete these comments)
